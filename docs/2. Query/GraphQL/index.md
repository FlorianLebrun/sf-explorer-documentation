# GraphQL

GraphQL offers very interesting use cases for salesforce. A number of tools are available in the community and **SF Explorer** ships with a built in version of **GraphiQL** with the following advantages:
* **No need to authenticate** - as easy as it should be
* **SOQL** transition tool
* **Sample queries** to get you started  
* **LWC** Generation with the graphql `wire` adapter

To give it a try navigate to **Code** and then select **GraphQL**:

## SOQL transition tool (beta)

:::warning
This feature is in beta, not all SOQL equivalent like subqueries are supported but it will come in future releases
:::

If you are not familiar with graphQL but you are a **SOQL ninja** ü•∑üèø, you can use the [SOQL transition tool](https://github.com/nicolas-despres/soql-to-graphql/blob/main/Readme.md):
* Write your query with **auto completion** and the syntax you know
* Generate the graphQL equivalent

### Playground

<GraphQL />

:::info
Beware that graphQL is case sensitive compared to SOQL
:::


## Provided examples
If you open the history button you will find a number of queries to help you get started:
* Search Accounts and their opportunities
* QueryAccountsWithCriteria
* QueryCasesWithCriteria
* Object info for Account and Case
