# Why Omnistudio Explorer?

With the official version of omnistudio I faced the following challenges
- No overview of what is being called in what order without executing the process
- Omnistudio Screens are more intended for edition rather than view: it means that input fields are disabled but the screen is not appropriate for somebody trying to understand what is going on.
- No option to visualize the dependencies between the components
- Lack of interface between the components: how do I know what is the expected input and output

I build Omniscript explorer to help resolve those issues, and in addition I am trying to:
- Consolidate required user rights
- Visualize the elapsed time on each step/construction element.

## Example

Here is an example of a first notice of loss claim process involving various elements:
