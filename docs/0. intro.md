## Architecture

SF Explorer as a chrome extension offers the following advantages:
* First and foremost: **No need to be admin of your org to install/use it**
* A **single installation** is enough for all your orgs - and single combined UI for multiple orgs
* React, Typescript, webpack and friends offer a better developer experience than lwc
* A security review done by the chrome team
* Automatic updates
* a user experience based on the Salesforce Design System
